# Plant Nutrition Prediction
The purpose of this project is to make predictions on plant nutrition based on 8 variables and the sample type. 
This is done by comparing the performance of several machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

After the analysis, the most accurate model was found to be Ridge Regression with Polynomial Transform and was used to predict inference data.
